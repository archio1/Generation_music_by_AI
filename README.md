# Generation_music_by_AI
In this project, we will be creating an Automatic Music Generation model using RNN(LSTM), Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). We will fetch notes from all music files which will then be fed into the model for prediction. Then finally we will create a MIDI file using these predicted notes. Programing langueage is Python.
